# Bryan Johnson's Sauna Protocol: Blueprint for Sweating Out Microplastics (Or Is It?)

Bryan Johnson, the 47-year-old tech entrepreneur spending $2 million annually to achieve the body of an 18-year-old, wants you to know that he has figured out how to sweat out the plastic in his testicles.

Yes, you read that correctly.

In a world where microplastics have been found in human blood, placentas, breast milk, and yes, [every single human testicle examined in a recent study](https://hsc.unm.edu/news/2024/05/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-testicular.html), Johnson claims his aggressive sauna protocol helped him reduce microplastics in his ejaculate by 85%. His broader detox results show seven environmental toxins either significantly reduced or completely eliminated after just 15 sessions.

Is this the ultimate biohack or an expensive placebo dressed up in scientific language? Let us examine the protocol, the claims, and the actual research.

## TL;DR: Bryan Johnson's Sauna Protocol

| Parameter | Johnson's Protocol |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Type** | Dry sauna (The Cold Plunge brand) |
| **Temperature** | 200°F (93°C) |
| **Frequency** | Daily, 7 days per week |
| **Duration** | 20 minutes per session |
| **Protection** | Ice pack on groin (testicular protection) |
| **Head Cooling** | Ice pack on head |
| **Hydration** | 36-40 oz total (half before, half after) |
| **Electrolytes** | 500-700mg sodium (based on sweat analysis) |
| **Timing** | Immediately post-workout, morning |

**Johnson's claimed results after 15 sessions:** 85% reduction in ejaculate microplastics, 100% elimination of certain phthalate metabolites (MEP, MEHP), 100% elimination of perchlorate, 65% drop in 2,4-D (herbicide), and significant cardiovascular improvements including 5.8% drop in central systolic blood pressure.

**Reality check:** The detox claims are contested by scientists. The cardiovascular benefits are well-supported by Finnish research. The ice pack on the testicles is... uniquely Bryan Johnson.

## The Man Who Would Not Die

Before we dissect the protocol, some context on our protagonist.

Bryan Johnson sold his payments company Braintree Venmo to PayPal for $800 million in 2013. Since then, he has dedicated his life and fortune to what he calls "Don't Die," a quest to reverse aging through obsessive measurement and intervention. His morning routine involves 111 pills. He eats the same meal (his "Super Veggie" blend) at the same time every day. He has received blood transfusions from his teenage son. He goes to bed at 8:30 PM with what he calls a "perfect bedtime erection score."

The man tracks literally everything.

So when Johnson announces that [sauna has helped him eliminate toxins](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/blogs/news/is-sauna-worth-the-hype), he is not guessing. He is presenting lab work, before-and-after measurements, and enough data to make a research scientist weep with joy (or frustration, depending on their view of n=1 experiments).

This is either the future of personalized medicine or the most expensive wellness theater on the planet. Possibly both.

## The Protocol: 200 Degrees of Commitment

### Temperature: Hotter Than Most Can Handle

Johnson uses a dry Finnish-style sauna set to 200°F (93°C). For reference, this is significantly hotter than the temperatures typically studied in longevity research (most Finnish studies used 80-85°C / 176-185°F).

At 200°F, you are approaching the upper limit of what sauna manufacturers recommend and what most humans can tolerate. The first week, Johnson reports, was brutal: leg cramps, disrupted sleep, and [electrolyte losses of 600-700mg sodium per 20-minute session](https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1920216917878657418) (measured via Gatorade sweat patch, because of course he measured it).

### The Controversial Addition: Ice on Your Balls

Here is where Johnson goes off-script from traditional sauna practice.

He places an ice pack on his groin throughout the session. The stated purpose: protecting testicular and sperm health from heat damage. Given that [one study found human testicles contained nearly three times more microplastics](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/22/1252831827/microplastics-testicles-humans-health) than dog testicles (330 vs 123 micrograms-per-gram), and that higher concentrations of certain microplastics correlated with lower sperm counts, Johnson's testicular paranoia is at least directionally logical.

Whether it is necessary or effective? The research does not exist. This is pure Johnsonian extrapolation.

### Timing and Stacking

Johnson saunas immediately after his morning workout. This timing may be strategic: [post-exercise sauna use has been shown to enhance BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)](https://newsroom.osfhealthcare.org/sweat-away-dementia-likely-brain-boost-in-saunas/) beyond exercise alone.

He also uses an ice pack on his head, presumably to maintain cognitive function while his body cooks.

## The Microplastic Problem: Why We Should All Be Concerned

Let us step back from Johnson's protocol to understand why anyone would want to sweat out plastic.

### Plastics Are Literally Everywhere

A [May 2024 study from the University of New Mexico](https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/200/2/235/7673133) examined 23 human testicles and found microplastics in every single sample. The most common type? Polyethylene, the plastic used in grocery bags and plastic bottles.

As Tracey Woodruff, an environmental health researcher at UC San Francisco, told reporters: "There has not been a body part that people have looked but have not found [microplastics] in."

The concentrations are not trivial. Human blood samples average [1.6 micrograms per milliliter](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-the-microplastics-found-in-testicles-a-health-danger/), with some individuals showing levels up to 10-12 micrograms per milliliter.

### The Health Implications

We are still early in understanding what this means for human health, but the signals are concerning:

- **Fertility:** Dog testicles with higher microplastic concentrations had lower sperm counts. Human sperm counts have been declining for decades.
- **Cardiovascular:** A [March 2024 study](https://www.ehn.org/microplastics-discovered-in-human-testicles-raising-health-concerns) found substantially raised risk of stroke, heart attack, and earlier death in people whose blood vessels were contaminated with microplastics.
- **Endocrine Disruption:** Many plastic additives (BPA, phthalates) are known endocrine disruptors that can interfere with hormones at very low concentrations.

The question is not whether we should be concerned. The question is what, if anything, we can do about it.

## Can You Actually Sweat Out Microplastics?

Here is where things get complicated.

### The Short Answer: Probably Not the Plastic Itself

When it comes to actual microplastic particles, [the evidence suggests sweat cannot remove them](https://caveatscientia.com/2025/04/15/can-you-sweat-out-microplastics-separating-science-from-myth/). These particles are structurally complex, often embed in tissues, and are not known to exit the body via sweat glands.

Your sweat glands are not equipped to move solid particles. Sweat is 99% water. Its primary function is thermoregulation, not waste removal.

### The Longer Answer: The Chemicals Are Different

While you may not sweat out plastic particles, you might sweat out some of the chemicals that leach from plastics:

- **BPA (Bisphenol A):** [One study found BPA in the sweat of 80% of participants](https://infraredsauna.com/blog/do-saunas-help-remove-toxins-from-the-body/), even when it was not detectable in their blood. Another study found [16 of 20 participants had BPA in sweat](https://www.sunlighten.com/gb-en/blog/bus-study/).

- **Phthalates:** Research found that concentrations of certain phthalate metabolites (MEHP) in sweat were [more than double those found in urine](https://www.sweattent.com/blogs/guide/do-saunas-help-detox-your-body).

- **Heavy Metals:** A University of Alberta research group found that [many toxic metals were preferentially excreted through sweat](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3776372/), including cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic.

### What the Skeptics Say

Not everyone is convinced.

Dr. Angela Lamb, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai, [told PBS](https://science.feedback.org/review/lack-reliable-evidence-supporting-sauna-bathing-detox-body) that the amount of heavy metals and BPA excreted in sweat is so small it does not make much meaningful difference to overall body burden.

As one critic put it: "Bryan Johnson did not discover a magic way to excrete plastic. He simply stopped eating and drinking it." They credit his results to "the unglamorous, $600 water filter under his sink and a new wooden cutting board."

There is truth to this. Johnson's comprehensive approach includes filtered water, glass containers, avoiding plastic packaging, and numerous other interventions. Isolating the sauna's contribution is essentially impossible.

### The PFAS Exception

One class of chemicals definitely does not come out in sweat: PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), the so-called "forever chemicals."

[Research shows](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3776372/) that induced perspiration does not hasten the clearance of PFHxS, PFOS, or PFOA from the body. Sweat is simply not effective for these compounds.

## Johnson's Specific Results: What Did He Actually Measure?

After 15 sauna sessions, Johnson's Blueprint team reported the following changes:

### Toxins Reduced or Eliminated

| Toxin | Change | What It Is |
|-------|--------|------------|
| MEP | -100% (undetectable) | Phthalate metabolite |
| MEHP | -100% (undetectable) | Phthalate metabolite |
| Perchlorate | -100% (undetectable) | Thyroid disruptor (rocket fuel, fireworks) |
| 2,4-D | -65% | Common herbicide |
| NAPR | -56% | Pesticide metabolite |
| HEMA | -56% | Industrial chemical |
| MBP | -15% | Phthalate metabolite |

### The 85% Microplastic Claim

Johnson reports reducing microplastics in his ejaculate from 165 to 20 particles per milliliter. This is a dramatic reduction, but attributing it solely to sauna is problematic. His protocol includes:

- Water filtration systems
- Glass and stainless steel food storage
- Avoiding plastic-wrapped foods
- Air filtration
- Numerous other environmental modifications

The sauna may have contributed, but it is one variable among dozens.

## The Cardiovascular Benefits: Where the Science is Strong

While the detox claims are contested, the cardiovascular benefits of sauna are well-documented.

### Johnson's Measured Improvements

After just seven sessions, Johnson reported:

- 5.8% drop in central systolic blood pressure
- Improved aortic flexibility
- Decreased arterial stiffness

These align perfectly with decades of Finnish research.

### The Finnish Data

The landmark [KIHD study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25705824/) tracking 2,315 Finnish men for 20+ years found:

- **4-7 sauna sessions per week:** 63% lower risk of sudden cardiac death
- **Sessions longer than 19 minutes:** 52% lower risk compared to sessions under 11 minutes
- **All-cause mortality:** 40% reduction in frequent users

A [follow-up study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-018-1198-0) of 1,688 men and women found cardiovascular mortality of just 2.7 events per 1,000 person-years among frequent sauna users, versus 10.1 events among once-per-week users.

This is where Johnson's protocol is on solid ground. The cardiovascular benefits of regular, high-heat sauna exposure are arguably the most well-established longevity intervention we have outside of exercise itself.

---

## How to Implement the Protocol (Sensibly)

Johnson's protocol is aggressive. Unless you are also spending $2 million per year on health monitoring, consider a more measured approach.

### The Beginner Protocol

**Week 1-2:**
- Temperature: 160-170°F (71-77°C)
- Duration: 10-15 minutes
- Frequency: 3-4 sessions per week

**Week 3-4:**
- Temperature: 175-185°F (80-85°C)
- Duration: 15-20 minutes
- Frequency: 4-5 sessions per week

**Week 5+:**
- Temperature: 185-200°F (85-93°C)
- Duration: 20 minutes
- Frequency: Daily if tolerated

### Non-Negotiable Safety Measures

1. **Hydration:** 16-20 oz water before, 20+ oz after. More if you sweat heavily.

2. **Electrolytes:** Consider supplementing sodium, potassium, and magnesium, especially for daily use.

3. **Exit When Needed:** Dizziness, nausea, or rapid heartbeat means get out immediately.

4. **Skip the Ball Ice (Probably):** Unless you have specific fertility concerns and are monitoring them clinically, the ice pack is optional theater.

### Who Should Not Follow This Protocol

- Pregnant women
- People with unstable cardiovascular conditions
- Those on medications affecting heat tolerance (diuretics, beta-blockers)
- Anyone who has not consulted their physician first

## The Bottom Line

Bryan Johnson's sauna protocol represents an interesting case study in aggressive self-experimentation. His cardiovascular results align with robust Finnish research. His detox claims are more complicated.

**What we know for certain:**
- Regular sauna use at adequate temperatures (175°F+) for adequate duration (20+ minutes) significantly improves cardiovascular markers
- This may translate to longer lifespan based on observational data
- Some plastic-related chemicals (BPA, phthalates) appear in sweat and may be excreted through sweating
- Actual microplastic particles likely cannot be sweated out

**What remains unclear:**
- Whether sweat excretion of toxins is meaningful relative to liver/kidney processing
- Whether Johnson's specific results are due to sauna, his comprehensive environmental modifications, or both
- Whether we should all be icing our testicles in the sauna

The protocol is worth considering for cardiovascular and longevity benefits alone. Those are real, supported by decades of research, and achievable without spending $2 million per year.

As for sweating out the plastic in your testicles? The jury is still out. But given that microplastics are now found in every human tissue examined, attempting to reduce your exposure and potentially enhance excretion seems like a reasonable bet.

Just maybe skip the ice pack on your groin unless you enjoy explaining that one to the other sauna users.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Bryan Johnson actually use an ice pack on his testicles during sauna?

Yes. He places ice packs on both his head and groin throughout his 20-minute sessions. The stated purpose is protecting testicular and sperm health from heat damage.

### Can I get the same results with an infrared sauna?

The Finnish longevity research was conducted using traditional dry saunas at 80-100°C (176-212°F). Infrared saunas operate at lower temperatures. While infrared may offer benefits, Johnson specifically uses and recommends dry sauna for his protocol.

### How long before I see results?

Johnson reported cardiovascular improvements after just 7 sessions. For toxin reduction claims, his data came after 15 sessions. The Finnish mortality data reflects years of consistent practice.

### Is 200°F safe?

For healthy individuals with proper hydration and heat adaptation, yes. However, this is an aggressive temperature. Start lower and build up gradually. Exit immediately if you feel unwell.

### What about the microplastics already embedded in my tissues?

This is the uncomfortable truth: we do not currently have proven methods for removing microplastics from tissues. The best approach may be reducing new exposure while research catches up.
